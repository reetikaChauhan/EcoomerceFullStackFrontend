# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
These are some of the demo features that I am currently reimplementing for  the Udder Milk online portal to enhance page load times, streamline the user experience, and create a single-page application using MongoDB, ReactJS, and Express. So far, I have achieved a 30% reduction in page load time by hosting images on AWS S3, which is particularly effective given the image-heavy nature of the site. Additionally, I have developed a nutrition recommendation engine utilizing MongoDBâ€™s scoring and querying features to attract more traffic. I am also working on a new feature that allows users to select their preferred delivery times and days, which automatically adjusts based on delivery zones. This feature involves integrating third-party libraries and is currently in the tech spike phase.
